GraphQL is a popular open-source API standard. It consists of a query language and a runtime for fulfilling queries (this second part is a fancy way of saying defined algorithms for execution, static validation, and type introspection).

We define GraphQL as a "standard" because it is an official specification that can be followed in order to create GraphQL technologies. There are many different client and server implementations available in a variety of languages. I've tried out `graphene` and `Apollo client`, for Python APIs and React clients respectively.
